            How are my details collected?
          </styled.h2>
          <styled.p>
            Aside from when you sign up to a training, ReactGraphQL.Academy is collecting your email through a newsletter sign-up form.
             
          </styled.p>
          <styled.h2>
            <Link
              name="4"
            />
            Why is it collected?
          </styled.h2>
          <styled.p>
            Apart from sending you details about any purchases with us, your email address is used to send you newsletters about React GraphQL Academy news and offers.

          <styled.h2>

            How is my information used?
          </styled.h2>
          <styled.p>
            Using your email as the primary way of setting up the account means that, whatever happens - issues with your account, important notifications about our service etc - we have a means of contacting you.
          </styled.p>
          <styled.p>
            Another key reason for collecting your email is to confirm your attendance at one of the trainings you have shown interest in attending. These communications will not be unsolicited and only initiated if you have indicated you’d like to receive them. These communications could be, but not excluded to, the following: Confirmation of event/training ticket purchase Reminder of upcoming events/training
          </styled.p>
          <styled.p>
            Lastly, if you have opted-in to the email newsletter, you will receive emails of a marketing nature that will feature events/trainings/services that you may not have indicated to us that you are interested in but we feel will enrich your experience with us. You are able to unsubscribe to these marketing emails by contactin us at

            Who will my information be shared with?
          </styled.h2>
          <styled.p>
            Your information security is very important to us so we will never share your personal details with third parties without your consent.
          </styled.p>
          <styled.p>
            The key parties we share information with will be:

            Third party training providers
          </styled.h3>
          <styled.p>
            When you sign up to a training/event/service, we will send third party providers your information to ensure that you are able to attend and get the best customer service possible. This is the information that you will provide to us when you sign up to the training/event/service.
             
          </styled.p>
          <styled.p>
            For example, we hold many training events at third party venues and to ensure you are allowed to enter the building, your details will be sent to them to create a vistors list.
          </styled.p>
          <styled.p>
            ReactGraphQL.Academy promises not to share your information with third parties that aren't connected to a training/event/service that you've signed up for without expressed consent from you.
