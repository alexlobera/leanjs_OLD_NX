            Another key reason for collecting your email is to confirm your attendance at one of the trainings you have shown interest in attending. These communications will not be unsolicited and only initiated if you have indicated you’d like to receive them. These communications could be, but not excluded to, the following: Confirmation of event/training ticket purchase Reminder of upcoming events/training

            There shouldn’t be any difference in the way that you have experienced ReactGraphQL.Academy previously. However, due to the way that the GDPR regulations have been introduced in May 2018, you will have to make sure you opt-in to email newsletters again from ReactGraphQL.Academy or any other LeanJS-related parties.
