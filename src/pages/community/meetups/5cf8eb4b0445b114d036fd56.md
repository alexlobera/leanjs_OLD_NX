title: Thinking in React - Introduction to ReactJS
city: Barcelona
---

ReactJS is a bit of a paradigm shift of what most devs are used to,it's very declarative and functional. The goal of the session will be to start "thinking in React". There will be a 30 minutes talk about how to use ReactJS, and then attendees will have 1.5 hours to solve a challenge (we encourage you to do pair programming to solve the exercise). There will be mentors to answer questions during the practise session.

Agenda:

18:30 - Doors open: time for networking, drinks, and snacks

19:15 - Talk "Thinking in React" by [Horacio Herrera](/about-us/#horacio-herrera)

21:00 - Time to go home :)
