In this session, we'll discuss some important concepts when it comes to building real-world GraphQL APIs like security design and Relay Cursor Connections Specification (used by Facebook in production ;)
We'll also see an alternative to wrap existent REST APIs and connect instead our resolvers to directly to Data Bases. For this, we'll connect to a MongoDB instance on the cloud.
