  - Join us for our first addition of the React, Redux GraphQL
    bootcamp NYC. Over 6 days we'll cover everything you need to
    know to become an expert in the react ecosystem with our
    accelerated learning format.
  - We have been working with local partners to organize a great
    venue which is easy to reach for East-coast based devs. In a
    hurry to do the bootcamp? We don't have a date yet for NYC but
    check out our upcoming London or Lisbon bootcamps coming up over the next few months.
  - Check out the 3 minute video on the left to get a feel for our
    bootcamps and here what some of our previous students think
    about the experience :-)
