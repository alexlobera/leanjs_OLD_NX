  - Join us for our first addition of the <b>React, Redux, GraphQL</b>
    bootcamp in <b>Berlin, Germany.</b> Our bootcamp format is formed of 6
    intensive training days where you'll learn through practical
    hands-on projects how to build production ready React
    applications and how tools like Redux and GraphQL fit into the picture.
  - Check out the 3 minute video on the left to get a feel for our
    bootcamps and here what some of our previous students think
    about the experience :-)
