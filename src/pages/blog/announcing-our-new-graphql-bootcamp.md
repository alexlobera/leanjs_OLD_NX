At ReactJS Academy, we’re keen to get more people into the world of the React ecosystem. Our expert developers have been coaching since the inception of the ecosystem, and our React and React Native training courses have gone down really well with developers and companies throughout the EU.

But anyone who knows anything about React will tell you there’s so much more to sink your teeth into! That said, we’re thrilled to be bringing a brand new course to developers. Today, we’re announcing our new [GraphQL Bootcamp](https://reactjs.academy/graphql/?utm_medium=direct&utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=graphql_exp&utm_content=graphql_announcement).

## Why GraphQL?

Ever heard of REST (Representational State Transfer)? If so, you’ll know that it’s the most popular but maybe not the best API architecture in the world. GraphQL is a lot better.

REST is pretty inaccurate for an API. For starters, it takes multiple trips to fetch data - the more trips it makes, the greater the chances are something will go wrong.

At other times, REST can under-fetch or over-fetch data, meaning that your app doesn’t have the material users want when they want it, or the app has too much data. If you then grow your app, you may end up with multiple endpoints, making it harder to maintain the codebase.

GraphQL works differently. It is a typed query language that defines *how *to ask for data. It uses a single endpoint to provide all data, which the client has complete control over. The client gets to choose what queries are sent, making over-fetching and under-fetching a thing of the past. GraphQL also eliminated the need for documentation as it allows for introspection, leading to a more explorable api via great community tooling that harnesses this.

In the end, GraphQL will give you a sleeker codebase that is way easier to maintain, and will help speed up your front-end dev time as a result!

These are just some of the reasons why we’re introducing a new [GraphQL Bootcamp](https://reactjs.academy/graphql/?utm_medium=direct&utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=graphql_exp&utm_content=graphql_announcement). We want to show more developers how they can benefit from implementing GraphQL and bring beautiful, sleek code to the community.

## Is a GraphQL Bootcamp right for me?

If you’re not already familiar with GraphQL, don’t worry. The GraphQL Bootcamp is a comprehensive, week-long course where you’ll first learn the fundamentals behind GraphQL.

We’ll then take you through Advanced GraphQL material, and even show you how to apply what you’ve learned to a real scenario by day three’s Real World GraphQL API class.

By the end of the week, you’ll have all you need to build Production-Ready GraphQL and React apps. Our expert developers will show you how to test what you build with GraphQL, and how to replace Redux with GraphQL. Likewise, we’ll show you GraphQL tooling to help speed up your front-end development time.
