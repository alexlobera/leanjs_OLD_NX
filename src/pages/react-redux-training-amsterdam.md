  - Join us for our first addition of the React, Redux GraphQL
    bootcamp in Amsterdam, Holland. Over the 6 days you'll learn all
    the essentials to build production applications with confidence
    within the react ecosystem. The date is currently, TBD but watch
    this space :-)
  - We have run several private trainings with local companies and
    run the popular JavaScript Amserdam meetup group we'd love to see you in the next one!
  - Check out the 3 minute video on the left to get a feel for our
    bootcamps and here what some of our previous students think
    about the experience :-)
